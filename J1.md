1. **Fault localization typically involves tracing back from the line of code producing the incorrect output to where the problem actually was**
2. - Your tests are not biased by your code
   - Writing tests helps you think about how you might write code
   - Writing tests helps you think about the requirements of your system
3.**Given the example of requirements for generating a password:**
- *It must have at least one number*
  - valid:It has atleast one number
  - invalid:It doesn't have any number
- *It must have at least one uppercase letter.*
  - valid: It has atleast one uppercase letter
  - invalid: It has no uppercase letter
- *It must have at least one lowercase letter.*
   - valid: It has atleast one lowercase letter
   - invalid: It has no lowercase letters
- *It must not contain the website gmail anywhere. (For example if we were generating a password for gmail accounts)*
   - valid:
   - invalid:
- *It can only be made up of letters, numbers, and the underscore.*
  - valid:
  - invalid
4. **Complete the truth table below to show what inputs we need to achieve active clause coverage for the following conditional:**
    | a > b| G |x < y | Predicate outcome | Clause responsible|
    |------|---|------|-------------------|-------------------|
    |  F   | F |   F  |        F          | (a>b) and G       |
    |  F   | F |   T  |        F          | (a > b) and G     |
    |  F   | T |   F  |        F          | (a > b) and x < y |
    |  F   | T |   T  |        T          | G and x < y       |
    |  T   | F |   F  |        F          | x < y             |
    |  T   | F |   T  |        T          | (a > b) and x < y |
    |  T   | T |   F  |        F          | x < y             |
    |  T   | T |   T  |        T          | (a>b)& G & x < y  |
 
5. `1->2->5->6->7`
-  `1->3->4->3->5->7`
-  Not finite because it `loops` over 3 and 4
